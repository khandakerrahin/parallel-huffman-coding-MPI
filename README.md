# <center> **Parallel Huffman Encoding and Decoding** </center>

We have evaluated the performance of our parallel Huffman coding implementation on several
randomly created text datasets of different sizes, and compared the results with those of existing
sequential and parallel implementations. Our results show that our implementation provides
substantial speedup compared to the sequential version, and is competitive with other parallel
implementations in terms of runtime. Additionally, we have also analyzed the scalability of our
implementation, and observed that it scales well with an increasing number of cores, thus
demonstrating its suitability for high-performance computing systems.
